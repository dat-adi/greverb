# GRE Verbal Script

This is a simple script for testing out my GRE Verbal Knowledge when it comes to vocabulary.

## What does it do?

The script reads from a file in the `data/` folder, and displays the word for a period of five seconds.
After which, the definition for the word is shown, for another five seconds.

The console refreshes afterward, with a new word, and a new definition, and the cycle repeats.
